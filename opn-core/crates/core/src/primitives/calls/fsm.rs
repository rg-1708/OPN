//! Call finite-state machine as data (OPN-CORE.md §10.4, roadmap Sprint 6
//! item 2): one pure `apply` function, no transition logic scattered across
//! handlers. Handlers load the session + participant rows `FOR UPDATE`, call
//! `apply`, persist the result, and emit; an illegal transition is `conflict`.
//!
//! Terminal rule: nothing leaves `Ended`, enforced structurally — `apply`
//! returns `Err` for any action against an ended session, and no arm produces a
//! transition *from* `Ended`. This is the Sprint 9 proptest target; keep it
//! pure (no I/O, no clock, no allocation beyond the slice it is handed).
