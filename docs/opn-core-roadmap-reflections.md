# OPN-CORE Roadmap — Implementation Reflections

Running log, one section per work session. Newest first. Companion to
[opn-core-roadmap.md](opn-core-roadmap.md); design-level amendments still go
to OPN-CORE.md as CDRs — this file records *how the build actually went*.

## 2026-07-18 — Sprint 0 (Foundations): built, compiles, partially verified

### What exists now

Workspace at `opn-core/` (repo root stays docs-only):

- **`crates/contracts`** — `ClientFrame` (flattened adjacently-tagged `Cmd`:
  `{id, cmd, payload}`), `ServerMsg` (untagged `Ack`/`Push`), closed 8-variant
  `ErrCode` + `Err` body, empty `Evt` with `class() -> EvtClass`
  (`Durable|Ephemeral`) as an exhaustive match — the compile-time forcing
  function for backpressure class is live from day one. `bin/export_ts`
  writes `bindings/*.ts` (committed; ts-rs 11).
- **`crates/core`** — lib + thin `main`. `Config::from_env()` (fail-fast,
  names the missing var), `AppState` with registry/limits stubs,
  `infra::ids::new_id()` (UUIDv7), `infra::db::world_tx()` (BEGIN +
  parameterized `set_config('app.world_id', …, true)`), `/healthz`
  (PG + Redis, 1 s timeouts, 503 on either failing), `/metrics` on the
  separate bind, all eight roadmap metric names registered at boot,
  JSON tracing. Migrations `0001` (roles + RLS convention doc) and `0002`
  (`_rls_canary` table proving the full RLS pattern).
- **`crates/loadgen`** — placeholder member per roadmap item 1.
- **Dev stack** — `docker-compose.dev.yml` (PG16/Redis7/MinIO+bucket
  one-shot), `justfile`, `.env.example`, `README.md` quickstart.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests
  against the compose stack, contracts drift gate
  (`export_ts` + `git diff --exit-code`), `cargo sqlx prepare --check`.
- **Tests** — golden wire-shape round-trips (literal JSON strings, compared
  as `Value`), config missing-var/default test, RLS canary
  (`#[sqlx::test]`, seeds two worlds as `opn_app`, asserts: bare query → 0
  rows, `world_tx` → own world only, cross-world insert rejected by
  WITH CHECK), `/healthz` 200/503 via `tower::oneshot`.

Toolchain pinned 1.97.0; `clippy::unwrap_used` denied workspace-wide;
resolved deps: axum 0.8.9, sqlx 0.9.0, redis 1.4.1, metrics 0.24,
ts-rs 11.1.

### Decisions closed during implementation (not in the roadmap)

1. **Two database URLs.** The roadmap wants migrations run by the owner role
   and the runtime pool as non-BYPASSRLS `opn_app`, but never says how one
   process does both. Closed: `OPN_MIGRATE_DATABASE_URL` (owner, used once
   at startup, pool closed after) + `DATABASE_URL` (app role, the 20-conn
   runtime pool). `.env.example` documents both.
2. **RLS policies use `current_setting('app.world_id', true)`** (missing_ok
   form): outside `world_tx` a query returns zero rows instead of erroring.
   The bare form would error on *every* query outside a world context,
   including legitimate infra reads. Documented in 0001's header.
3. **`CREATE ROLE` is guarded** (existence check + `duplicate_object`
   handler) because roles are cluster-wide while migrations run per-database
   — `#[sqlx::test]` creates a DB per test, concurrently. Without the
   handler, parallel test DBs race the existence check.
4. **`Err` struct is Rust-named `ErrBody`** (`#[ts(rename = "Err")]`), so
   the TS surface matches the design doc without shadowing Rust's prelude.
5. **`u64`/`i64` wire integers export as TS `number`, not `bigint`**
   (`#[ts(type = …)]` overrides) — the wire is JSON numbers; frame ids and
   seqs never approach 2^53.
6. **ts-rs cannot flatten an empty enum**: `ServerMsg::Push.evt` carries
   `#[ts(skip)]` with a `ponytail:` note; swaps to `#[ts(flatten)]` when the
   first `Evt` variant lands (Sprint 2). Until then a Push cannot exist on
   the wire, so the TS type is accurate in effect.
7. **`sqlx::test` needs CREATEDB**, so test runs use the migrate role
   (`just test` overrides `DATABASE_URL`; CI sets it directly). RLS-on
   testing (cross-cutting rule 4) is still honored: the canary test opens a
   *second* pool as `opn_app` against the per-test DB and runs all
   assertions through it. Store tests from Sprint 1 on must follow this
   pattern — worth extracting a small test-support helper when the second
   test needs it.

### Exit criteria status (updated same day, after docker install)

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| Compose up → `cargo run` → 200 `/healthz` | **PASS** — stack up (postgres/redis/minio healthy, bucket created), binary boots, migrations apply, `/healthz` 200. |
| CI green, drift gate demonstrably fails on uncommitted change | **Not yet** — repo has no remote/first push. Workflow file ready. |
| RLS canary passes as `opn_app` | **PASS** (after a real bug fix — see below). |
| Metric names visible on `/metrics` | **PASS** — all eight `opn_*` families render at boot. |

Full suite green against the live stack: 16 tests, clippy zero warnings.

### Bug found by running against real Postgres (the whole point of rule 4)

The RLS policy used `current_setting('app.world_id', true)::uuid`, believing
the two-arg form's NULL-when-unset covers the no-context case. It does — but
only until any transaction on that *pooled connection* has run
`set_config(..., true)`: at commit the GUC reverts to an **empty string**,
not to "unset", and `''::uuid` then throws `22P02` on every subsequent
bare query on that connection. The canary test hit it immediately (seed via
`world_tx`, then bare query on the same pool). Fix:
`NULLIF(current_setting('app.world_id', true), '')::uuid` — now part of the
documented convention in migration 0001 (NOTE 2). Every future domain-table
policy must use the NULLIF form. A desk-checked migration and a green
compile both missed this; only the live-DB test caught it.

### Reflection

- **The environment gap is the sprint's real blocker, not code.** Everything
  DB-touching is written test-first but unproven. Before starting Sprint 1
  (which is *mostly* DB semantics — number assignment races, session
  revocation), either install docker/podman on this host or push to GitHub
  and let CI be the proving ground. Recommend doing both; Sprint 1's
  concurrent-mint test is exactly the kind that needs fast local iteration.
- **Subagent split worked**: compose/justfile/env, CI workflow, and
  migration SQL went to three parallel opus agents with tight specs; all
  three delivered usable output. Two agent bugs caught in review — CI passed
  a file path to the toolchain action's `toolchain:` input (invalid), and
  `up -d --wait` would fail on the one-shot bucket container exiting. Both
  fixed by naming services and letting rustup read the toolchain pin.
  Lesson: agents are fine for scaffolding, but CI files need review against
  actual action semantics, and anything touching *startup ordering* deserves
  main-thread eyes.
- **Deferred, deliberately**: the `Cmd`/`Evt` coverage match-test
  (cross-cutting rule 2) — with zero handlers, every arm would name a
  placeholder, making the test decorative. It lands with the protocol
  harness in Sprint 2 where the roadmap's own exit criteria place it. The
  ts-rs 12 upgrade (11.1 resolved; 12.0.1 exists) — pinned where cargo put
  it, upgrade when something needs it.
- **Not committed**: work left as untracked files; committing is the
  operator's call.

### Next session

1. Get a container runtime (or push + CI) and burn down the four unverified
   exit criteria — Sprint 0 is *not done* until they pass, per the
   scope-bound rule.
2. Then Sprint 1: schema migration for the seven identity tables (RLS per
   table, same file), API-key auth + `TenantAuth` extractor, session mint
   with the number-assignment retry loop, JWT + `Identity`, janitor v0
   skeleton. The concurrent-mint test (32 tasks, one world) is the sprint's
   named bug magnet — write it before the mint handler.
